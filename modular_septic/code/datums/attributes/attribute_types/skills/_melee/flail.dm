/**
 * FLAIL WEAPONS
 *
 * A flail is any flexible, unbalanced weapon with its mass concentrated in the head.
 * Such a weapon cannot parry if you have already attacked with it on your turn.
 * Because flails tend to wrap around the targetâ€™s shield or weapon, attempts to block them are at -2 and
 * attempts to parry them are at -4.
